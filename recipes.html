<h1>Recipes-World's Best Scrambled Eggs</h1>
<p>I adopted the recipe from a book called Sydney Food by Bill Granger. Ever since tasting these eggs on my 1st visit to Bill's resturant in Kins Cross, Sydney, I have been after the recipe. I have since transformed into what I really believe are the best scrambled eggs I have vere tasted.</p>
<p>This recipe is whst I call a "very special breakfast", just look at the ingredients to see why. It has to be to tasted to be believed.</p>

</ul>

	<li>Pour egg mixture into pan and wait until it starts setting around the edge of the pan(around 20 seconds).</li>
	<li>Using a wooden spatula, bring the mixture into the center as if it were an omelet, and let it cook for another 20 seconds.</li>
